### Project 2 - Relations between education, patents, work sector and income over time-V6

The purpose of this project is to investigate the relations between education, patents, work sector and income over a specific period of time, for which we have the data available.
The objective is to support, through data analysis, 4 few theories that I formulated.
In particular:

    1) Education should have a positive impact on income, as the more knowledgeable people of a specific country are, the more that country should be able to produce prosperity
    2) The number of patent applications in a country should have a positive impact on its income, due to the increase of its technological level
    3) Education should have a positive impact in the number of patent applications, as a higher knowledge helps in generating innovative ideas
    4) Also the main sectors have an impact on the income, as a country being "service-oriented" should be a sign that its technology is advanced, as opposite as a country for which the main sector is "agricultural" or "industrial"
